Data Quality Attributes
------------------------
How data quality plays out in an organization largely depends on how that organization defines it and prioritizes it. However, there are seven useful indicators of quality.

Relevancy: how relevant the data is for the business.

Accuracy: how accurate the data is.

Completeness: whether the data is complete and in a stable state.

Consistency: how consistent the data is across the organization. If the same piece of data from multiple sources is transformed using the same application, the output should always be the same.

Conformity: whether the data adheres to the standards and format expected by business rules.

Uniqueness: whether multiple copies of the same data are available in the enterprise or if itâ€™s the single source of truth.

Timeliness: how timely the data is for current business needs.
